# Python Programming Guide

## Introduction
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

## Basic Syntax
Python uses indentation to define code blocks. Here's a simple example:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
```

## Data Types
Python has several built-in data types:
- Strings: "Hello World"
- Numbers: 42, 3.14
- Lists: [1, 2, 3]
- Dictionaries: {"key": "value"}

## Best Practices
1. Use meaningful variable names
2. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
3. Write docstrings for functions
4. Handle exceptions properly
